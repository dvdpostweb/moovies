The field of classical Artificial Intelligence (AI) coalesced in the 1950s
drawing on an understanding of the brain from neuroscience, the new
mathematics of information theory, control theory referred to as cyber-
netics, and the dawn of the digital computer. AI is a cross-disciplinary
field of research that is generally concerned with developing and in-
vestigating systems that operate or act intelligently. It is considered
a discipline in the field of computer science given the strong focus on
computation.
